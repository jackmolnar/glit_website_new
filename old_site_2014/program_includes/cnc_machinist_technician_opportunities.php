<h2>CNC/Machinist Technician</h2>
<h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
<hr />
<p>Employers are expected to continue to have difficulty finding computer-controlled machine tool operators and numerical tool and process control programmers with the necessary skills and knowledge.&nbsp; Technology is not expected to affect the employment of machinists as significantly as that of most other production occupations, because machinists monitor and maintain many automated systems. Due to modern production techniques, employers prefer workers, such as machinists, who have a wide range of skills and are capable of performing almost any task in a machine shop.</p>
