<h2>Refrigeration, Heating, Ventilation &amp; Air Conditioning (RHVAC) Technology</h2>
<h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
<hr />
Employment of heating, air-conditioning, and refrigeration mechanics and installers is projected to increase 9 percent during the 2006-16 decade.&nbsp; As the population and stock of buildings grows, so does the demand for residential, commercial, and industrial climate-control systems. Residential HVACR systems generally need replacement after 10 to 15 years; the large number of homes built in recent years will enter this replacement timeframe by 2016. The increased complexity of HVACR systems, which increases the possibility that equipment may malfunction, also will create opportunities for service technicians. (U.S.BLS)<br />
